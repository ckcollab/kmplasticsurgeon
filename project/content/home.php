					<h4>Wow, <p>I</p> <p>Couldn't</p> <p>Be</p> <p>Happier!</p></h4>
					<p>I had a breast reduction and liposuction from bra line to knee area (both sides) Wow, I couldn't be happier! Dr Kai is truly a perfectionist! She listened to what I wanted and I could see immediately that the results are what I was hoping for. I am 3 weeks out and still a little swelling. Was painful (mostly due to lipo) but would definately recommend it.</p>

					<h4>A <p>Helping</p> <p>Hand</p></h4>
					<p>I thought I’d extend a thank you.... You put my husband’s hand back together after a bad car accident on New Years’ Day some years ago. The hand has only minimal scarring, despite 54 stitches, and he is able to play guitar again, something we weren't sure was going to happen. I remember your work very vividly that day as you performed the surgery in the ED due to lack of an available OR and I was able to watch. So thank you for salvaging his hand!</p>
